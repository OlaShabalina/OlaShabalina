### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Olga and I just left my real estate sales job to become a software developer.

I got a lot of knowledge from Inco bootcamp (www.inco.org.au) and Udemy (www.udemy.com). I'm also going through my first software development internship with https://mav3rik.com/ .

I've completed multiple projects using: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including Nodejs and Express), jQuery, React, Sass, PostgreSQL/MongoDB databases, Bootstrap and Materialize CSS frameworks.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning Python and AWS.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on whatever you guys are looking to create. Any knowledge is useful. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: o.shabalina@outlook.com or contact form on https://olgashabalina.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I lived in 4 different countries, India is my favourite :-)
