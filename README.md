### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Olga. I recently left my real estate sales job to become an IT professional.

I got a lot of knowledge from [Inco Academy](www.inco.org.au) bootcamp, [Udemy](www.udemy.com) and software development internship at [Mav3rik](https://mav3rik.com). Earlier this year I joined [Rea Group](https://www.rea-group.com/) as an Associate Data Engineer.

Here is the tech stack I used: **HTML**, **CSS/Sass**, **JavaScript (including Nodejs, Express, Reactjs/Nextjs)**, **PostgreSQL/MongoDB**, **Python**.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning Python and AWS.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on whatever you guys are looking to create. Any knowledge is useful. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: o.shabalina@outlook.com or contact form on https://olgashabalina.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I lived in 4 different countries, India is my favourite :-)
