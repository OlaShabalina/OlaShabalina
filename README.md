### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Olga and I'm currently in the proccess of transitioning from a real estate agent to a software developer.

I got a lot of knowledge from Inco bootcap (www.inco.org.au) and Udemy (www.udemy.com). I've completed multiple projects using: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including Nodejs and Express) with PostgreSQL database.
