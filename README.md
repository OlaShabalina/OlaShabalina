### Hi there 👋

My name is Olga and I'm currently in the proccess of transitioning from a real estate agent to a software developer.

I got a lot of knowledge from Inco bootcamp (www.inco.org.au) and Udemy (www.udemy.com). 

I've completed multiple projects using: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including Nodejs and Express), jQuery, React, Sass, PostgreSQL/MongoDB databases, Bootstrap and Materialize CSS frameworks.  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ecommerce website in React.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to connect front-end and back-end in React.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on whatever you guys are looking to create. Any knowledge is useful. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with job hunting.
